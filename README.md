# BLOGIFY
FULL STACK BLOG MANAGMENT WEBSITE USING MERN STACK
This comprehensive blog management platform was built as part of my final year project for the Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) degree. Developed using the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js—the project reflects my strong command over full-stack web development. Through this experience, I honed both my front-end and back-end skills, creating a responsive, user-friendly interface paired with a powerful backend. The project not only represents the successful completion of my academic journey but also underscores my passion for learning and innovation in web technologies.
